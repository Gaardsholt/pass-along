# Docker ignore rules, largely based on .gitignore and Docker best practices
# This helps keep the build context small and avoid including sensitive or unnecessary files.

# Version control files
.git/
.gitignore
# .dockerignore # This file itself. Usually not needed to ignore.
# Dockerfile # If your Dockerfile is in the context and you don't want it in the image.

# Go specific build artifacts and files
# Binaries for programs and plugins
*.exe
*.exe~
*.dll
*.so
*.dylib
pass-along

# Test binary, built with `go test -c`
*.test

# Output of the go coverage tool
*.out

# Dependency directories
# These are often better handled via multi-stage Docker builds
# by copying go.mod/go.sum and running `go mod download` or `go build` inside a build stage.
/vendor/
/Godeps/

# IDE & Editor specific files
.vscode/
*.code-workspace
.history/
.ionide

# OS specific files (from .gitignore)
.DS_Store

# Add any other files or directories that should not be part of the Docker context.
# Examples:
# *.log
# local_config.yaml
# /docs/
